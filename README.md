# Black Holes as Persistent Non-Commutation between Stabilization and Observation

## Overview

The paper develops a minimal structural reformulation of black-hole regions based on the persistent non‑commutation between:

- **internal stabilization** (idempotent equilibration, decoherence, gravitational settling)  
- **external observation** (information‑losing projection to observable descriptions)

A natural comparison map relates stabilized configurations to stabilized observations.  
Its failure to be invertible identifies a mismatch between internal distinctions and observable structure.  
A **black-hole region** is defined as a full subcategory on which this non‑commutation is robust under restriction.

Horizons arise as commutation boundaries.  
Evaporation corresponds to the dynamical shrinkage of the non‑commuting region.  
Page‑curve behavior and island constructions follow from structural properties of this mismatch.

The framework assumes no geometry, Hilbert space, or microscopic dynamics.
