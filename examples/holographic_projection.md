## Holographic Projection as a Structural Instance of Non-Commutation

This example illustrates how the abstract framework aligns with holographic intuition without assuming AdS/CFT machinery.

### Categories
- **C**: bulk configurations (fields, states, or effective geometries)  
- **O**: boundary‑accessible observables

### Stabilization
Let \(S\) represent bulk equilibration:
- gravitational settling  
- coarse‑grained relaxation  
- bulk decoherence  

Idempotence reflects that once equilibrated, further stabilization does not change the effective bulk description.

### Observation
Let \(\Pi\) be a boundary projection:
\[
\Pi:\text{bulk data} \to \text{boundary observables}.
\]
This is non‑faithful: many bulk distinctions are invisible at the boundary.

### Observable stabilization
Let \(S_O\) be coarse‑graining on the boundary (e.g., smearing, operator averaging).

### Comparison
\[
\eta_X:\Pi(SX)\to S_O(\Pi X)
\]

### Non‑invertibility and islands
If bulk stabilization preserves distinctions that boundary projection erases, then \(\eta_X\) is non‑invertible.  
A region \(I\subseteq C\) where \(\eta_X\) becomes invertible corresponds to an **island**:  
bulk information becomes accessible through the boundary description.

This provides a structural interpretation of island formulas without invoking replica wormholes or specific entanglement entropy definitions.
