## Intuition: Stabilization, Observation, and Non-Commutation

The framework separates two structural operations:

- **Stabilization**  
  Internal equilibration, decoherence, or gravitational settling.  
  It preserves distinctions that matter for the internal effective description.

- **Observation**  
  Projection to externally accessible data.  
  It is typically information‑losing.

These operations need not commute.  
When stabilization preserves distinctions that observation erases, the mismatch becomes structural.

A **black‑hole region** is a domain where this mismatch persists under restriction.  
This captures the idea that internal structure remains inaccessible even after coarse‑graining.

Horizons arise as boundaries where commutation fails.  
Evaporation corresponds to the shrinkage of the non‑commuting region.  
Page behavior reflects the expansion and contraction of this region.

The framework does not assume geometry, Hilbert spaces, or microscopic dynamics.  
It isolates the information problem as a structural incompatibility between internal and observable operations.
