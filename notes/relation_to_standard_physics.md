## Relation to Standard Physical Frameworks

### Decoherence and equilibration
Stabilization \(S\) generalizes decoherence in a pointer basis or coarse‑grained equilibration.  
It preserves distinctions relevant to the internal effective description.

### Observation and coarse-graining
Observation \(\Pi\) models partial trace, projection to macroscopic variables, or operational coarse‑graining.  
It is inherently information‑losing.

### Black holes
In semiclassical gravity, black holes hide internal structure behind horizons.  
In this framework, they are regions where stabilization preserves distinctions that observation cannot reflect.

### Page curve
If the non‑commuting region grows and later shrinks, any monotone entropy functional reproduces Page‑type behavior.  
This does not rely on specific entanglement entropy formulas.

### Islands
Islands correspond to regions where commutation is restored:  
\[
\eta_X \text{ invertible on } I.
\]  
This enlarges the effective observable domain, matching the operational meaning of island constructions.

### Geometry
Geometric horizons are special cases of commutation boundaries.  
The framework applies even when geometry is emergent or unavailable.
